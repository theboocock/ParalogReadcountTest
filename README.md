ParalogReadcountTest
====================

R package to implement the PRT test using readcount data.

Find genomic regions with similar GC-content randomly sample from 1,000 or so regions and take the ratio.

Should this be a simple bayesian model? Would be really good practice, might enable use to call CNV in each individual sample. 
Cluster the PRT values between samples and get an idea of the Read-count distribution.
